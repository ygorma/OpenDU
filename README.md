# The Idea
Community has proven to be the strong arm of flight sim environment with time, this enviorioment which lacks a freeware, customizable and scalable Display Unit software. In the other hand, Python is one of the most popular programming languages with a very short learning curve and has the advantage to work in multiple platforms, which opens the possibility of getting rid off Windows the most annoying and painful obstacle when working with home cockpits.

OpenDU is a python based application with the purpose of creating a community based display unit of any kind for use within flight simulators, such as Primary Flight Displays, Control Display Units, Instructor Station or even general aviation gauges for use in home cockpits,  

It uses the PyGame library and Vulkan to render the displays and connects via SimConnect to Flight Simulator or Prepar3D and via TCP through XPlane.

The goal of this project is to lower the software costs of homecockpit building for personal and commercial use.

# Pre-requisites
- Python3 with PiP (Package Installer / Manager)
- PyGame Library (python -m pip install -U pygame --user)

# Dev Schedule
The project is still under development and there is a lot of work to do, so don't expect a working project when you download.

# Developer Team
